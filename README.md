📘 School Student Health & Wellbeing — Technical Analysis Report

## Capstone Project Summary

## 🔍 Project Overview

-This project analyzes the My Health, My School (MHMS) annual survey, which collects data from primary and secondary students in Leeds, UK. The goal is to understand the factors influencing students’ health, wellbeing, and quality of life, and to identify how school environments shape their mental and physical health.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

-Student wellbeing is affected by a combination of daily lifestyle habits, school environment, social relationships, technology usage, and emotional factors. These influences are not typically measured together in an integrated way.
This project uses the MHMS dataset to identify which variables—diet, sleep, activity, screen time, school support, bullying, emotional state—are most strongly linked to students’ self-reported enjoyment of life.

## 🎯 Objectives

-Identify key factors linked to student wellbeing and life enjoyment

-Understand the school’s role in shaping students’ knowledge and habits

-Provide recommendations to improve health, safety, and emotional support in schools

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The MHMS dataset includes responses from students in Years 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11.
Survey structure:

-Direct questions (single response)

-Categorical multiple-choice questions

-Numeric multiple-choice questions
-Data was divided into 3 tables and processed using Excel, Python, and Power BI for cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## 🛠 Data Preparation

-Excel: removed irrelevant columns, split data into 3 datasets, filtered target age groups.
-Python: cleaned values, standardized categories, converted wide data into long format, converted Yes/No/X responses into numeric values.
-Power BI: corrected text labels, applied data types, merged categories, generated visuals.

## 📊 Key Findings
1️⃣ Do students enjoy their lives?

-77% enjoy their lives

-7% do not

-16% are unsure

2️⃣ Why do students enjoy their lives?

-Positive lifestyle habits: good sleep, breakfast frequency, healthy diet, physical activity, reduced risky behaviors.
-School influence: students who feel their school encourages a healthy lifestyle, teaches about risks (bullying, alcohol, smoking), and promotes social/emotional learning report higher wellbeing.
-Emotional outcomes: strong school & home support link to higher confidence and reduced loneliness/sadness.

3️⃣ Why do some students NOT enjoy their lives?

-Negative school experiences: bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, social conflicts.
-Insufficient school support: students feel underprepared to cope with anger, stress, sadness, or pressure.
-Emotional impact: increased sadness, stress, and low enjoyment of school.
